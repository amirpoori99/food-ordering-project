# 🎨 AUT-Food Frontend (JavaFX)

## 📌 Introduction

This is the **JavaFX-based frontend** of the AUT-Food system, developed as part of the **Advanced Programming Course – Spring 1404** at **Amirkabir University of Technology**.

The application provides a complete graphical interface for a food ordering system that supports multiple user roles:

- 🛒 Customers
- 🏪 Sellers (Restaurant Owners)
- 🚚 Couriers
- 🔧 Admins

It communicates with the backend through a RESTful API based on the `aut_food.yaml` specification and implements all features described in the official project documentation.

- All endpoints conform to the OpenAPI standard defined in `aut_food.yaml`
- JSON parsing is handled via internal utility classes

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Full GUI testing via user interaction
- Works seamlessly with the backend project
- Handles user input validation and API error responses
